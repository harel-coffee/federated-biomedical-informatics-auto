# federated-biomedical-informatics
Python scripts for stress detection by using traditional deep learning methods and privacy preserving federated deep learning approach.

We used federated learning in two approaches. The first approach is combining individual data to form a dataset by preserving the privacy of individuals. 
Federated_personalized.py file contains the code for that purpose. In order to compare, we also tested the traditional approach in traditional_personalized.py file.

The second approach is using federated learning for merging different datasets by preserving privacy of individuals. Federated_datasets_merger.py file contains the code for that purpose. In order to compare, we also tested the traditional approach in traditional_datasets_merger.py file.

The csv files are sample extracted features for using in the python scripts.
